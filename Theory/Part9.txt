How to make sure a servlet is loaded at the application startup?
Usually, servlet container loads a servlet on the first client request. Sometimes the servlet is heavy and takes time to loads, we might want to load it on application startup. We can use a load-on-startup element with servlet configuration in the web.xml file or use WebServlet annotation loadOnStartup variable to tell the container to load the servlet on system startup.


<servlet>
<servlet-name>foo</servlet-name>
<servlet-class>com.foo.servlets.Foo</servlet-class>
<load-on-startup>5</load-on-startup>
</servlet>
The load-on-startup value should be int, if it’s a negative integer then servlet container will load the servlet based on client requests and requirement but if it’s 0 or positive, then the container will load it on application startup.

If there are multiple servlets with load-on-startup value such as 0,1,2,3 then lower integer value servlet will be loaded first.

How do we go with database connection and log4j integration in servlet?
If you work with database connection a lot in your web application, its best to initialize it in a servlet context listener and set it as a context attribute for other servlets to use.

Integrating Log4j is also very easy in web applications, all we need is a log4j configuration XML or property file and then configure it in a servlet context listener.

For complete example, please look into Servlet Database and Log4j Example.
